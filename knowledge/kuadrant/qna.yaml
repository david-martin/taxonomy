      Kuadrant provides connectivity, security and service protection capabilities in both a single and multi-cluster environment.
      It exposes these capabilities in the form of Kubernetes CRDs that implement the Gateway API concept of policy attachment.'
    question: What is Kuadrant?
  - answer: '
      Gateway API is a new standard for Ingress from the Kubernetes community.
      Gateway API is the core API that Kuadrant integrates with.
      Kuadrant provides Kubernetes CRDs that implement the Gateway API concept of policy attachment.
      These policy APIs can target specific Gateway API resources such as `Gateways` and `HTTPRoutes` to extend their capabilities and configuration.'
    question: What is Gateway API?
  - answer: '
      Istio is a Gateway API provider that Kuadrant integrates with via WASM and Istio APIS to provide service protection capabilities.
      Kuadrant configures Envoy via the Istio control plane in order to enforce the applied policies and register components such as Authorino and Limitador.
      Istio is used by RateLimitPolicy and AuthPolicy Kuadrant resources.'
    question: What is Istio?
  - answer: '
      The components of Kuadrant are categorised as control plane and data plane components.
      The control plane components are the Kuadrant Operator, Limitador Operator, Authorino Operator, Cert-Manager and DNS Operator.
      The data plane components are Limitador, Authorino and the WASM Shim.'
    question: What are the components of Kuadrant?
  - answer: '
      There are four policies that Kuadrant exposes.
      They are RateLimitPolicy, AuthPolicy, DNSPolicy and TLSPolicy.'
    question: What policies does Kuadrant expose?
  - answer: '
      The Kuadrant Operator is responsible for installing and configuring other control plane and data plane components, exposing policy CRDs like RateLimitPolicy and AuthPolicy, and configuring gateways to leverage these policies.'
    question: What role does the Kuadrant Operator play?
